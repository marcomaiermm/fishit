# fishit

Simple fishbot with pixel detection for WoW Classic. I just made it for me so use it with caution.
Requirements are in Pipfile.lock

You can set the duration in the dropdown menu

Works best if:
 
Camera is zoomed in (first person)

Fishing ability is on '1'

Pan the camera so that the horizon of the water is in the center of the screen (water has to be in the lower half for detection!)
